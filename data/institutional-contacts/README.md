# Institutional Contacts

Contact references for EU institutions and agencies involved in citizen engagement processes. Document provenance and update cadence.

## Files
- `institutional-contacts.csv`: structured contacts for document access, petitions, complaints, and FOI relay services.

## Contribution notes
- Verify addresses against official sources; add `last_verified`.
- Prefer generic functional mailboxes over individual staff to avoid churn.
- Note web portals where relevant (e.g., petitions, Ombudsman).

## What these contacts are for
- **Document access (Reg. 1049/2001)**: Functional inboxes to request documents from the Commission (SG or DG-specific), Council, EP, and ECB.
- **DG-specific mailboxes (CNECT, COMP, JUST, HOME, ENER, SANTE, MOVE, ENV, RTD, FISMA, TAXUD, GROW, DIGIT, CLIMA)**: Use when your request clearly falls in that policy domain (e.g., digital/AI; competition; justice/consumer; home affairs; energy; health; transport; environment; research; financial services; taxation/customs; internal market/industry/standards; internal IT; climate).
- **EP committee secretariats (IMCO, ITRE, LIBE, JURI, ECON)**: For committee process questions, hearing info, and to file submissions relevant to their remit (internal market/consumer, industry/research/energy, civil liberties/data protection, legal affairs, economic/financial).
- **PETI / petitions**: Submit and track petitions to Parliament (web portal + functional mailbox).
- **Ombudsman**: Maladministration complaints and follow-up.
- **asktheeu.org**: Unofficial FOI relay platform; public by default and useful to research similar requests.
- **ENISA**: EU Agency for Cybersecurity (general/press contact; use for coordination/briefings).
