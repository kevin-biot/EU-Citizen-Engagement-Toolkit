# Institutional Contacts

Contact references for EU institutions and agencies involved in citizen engagement processes. Document provenance and update cadence.

## Files
- `institutional-contacts.csv`: structured contacts for document access, petitions, complaints, and FOI relay services.

## Contribution notes
- Verify addresses against official sources; add `last_verified`.
- Prefer generic functional mailboxes over individual staff to avoid churn.
- Note web portals where relevant (e.g., petitions, Ombudsman).
