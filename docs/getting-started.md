**Template:**
- [Confirmatory Application](../templates/level-2-confirmatory/confirmatory-application-template.md)

### Level 3: Court Preparation (Building Your Case)
**What:** Legal research, evidence gathering, standing analysis  
**Time:** 20-40 hours  
**Cost:** €0 (AI-assisted research)  
**When:** Administrative remedies exhausted, you're ready for judicial review

**Resources:**

---

## Decision Tree: Where Should I Start?

### Question 1: Has a formal decision been made that affects you?

**NO → Start at Level 0**
- Comment on draft regulations
- Request relevant documents
- Petition Parliament on issue

**YES → Continue to Question 2**

### Question 2: Have you exhausted direct contact with the institution?

**NO → Contact institution first**
- Email relevant unit
- Submit formal complaint to institution
- Give reasonable time for response (2-4 weeks)

**YES → Continue to Question 3**

### Question 3: What went wrong?

**Procedural failure (delays, lack of transparency, no proper reasoning):**
→ Level 1: Ombudsman Complaint (create political pressure while building record)

**FOI request refused:**
→ Level 2: Confirmatory Application (required before court)

**Decision clearly unlawful:**
→ Level 3: Court Preparation (if standing requirements met)

## Your First Action: Choose a Starter Project

**Recommendation: Start Small to Learn Process**

### Option A: Easy Win (2-4 hours)
Submit public comment on active consultation in your domain
- **Why:** Lowest barrier, web-based, immediate feedback
- **Learning:** How institutions structure engagement, format expectations
- **Template:** [Consultation Response](../templates/level-0-public-comment/consultation-response-template.md)

### Option B: Transparency Request (3-5 hours)
Request documents about topic you're researching
- **Why:** Builds evidence base, teaches institutional responses
- **Learning:** Exception patterns, what institutions disclose vs. hide
- **Template:** [FOI Request](../templates/level-1-administrative/foi-request-template.md)

### Option C: Accountability Action (6-12 hours)
File Ombudsman complaint about procedural failure you've experienced
- **Why:** Creates official record, political pressure
- **Learning:** Investigation process, institutional defenses
- **Template:** [Ombudsman Complaint](../templates/level-1-administrative/ombudsman-complaint-template.md)

## Essential Setup (Before You Start)

### 1. Document Management System

**Create folder structure:**
```
EU-Engagement/
├── 00-Research/
├── 01-Drafts/
├── 02-Submitted/
├── 03-Responses/
├── 04-Evidence/
└── 05-Timeline/
```

**Save everything:**
- Submission confirmations
- Reference numbers  
- All correspondence
- Deadline calculations
- Evidence files

### 2. AI Tools (Choose One)

**Claude Pro (Anthropic):** €20/month
- Excellent for long-form legal writing
- Strong research synthesis
- Good at procedural compliance checking

**ChatGPT Plus (OpenAI):** €20/month  
- Strong template generation
- Quick procedural guidance
- Good for quality control

**Free Tier:** Both offer free versions (rate limited)

### 3. Deadline Tracking

**Spreadsheet with columns:**
- Action taken
- Date submitted
- Reference number
- Deadline for response
- Status
- Next step

**Calendar alerts:** Set reminders 1 week before deadlines

### 4. Contact List

**Build database of:**
- Institutional email addresses
- Portal URLs
- Reference formats
- Key personnel (if identifiable)

## Working With AI (Critical Success Factor)

### Effective Prompting Strategy

**For Document Generation:**
```
"I need to draft [document type] for [purpose]. Key facts: [3-5 bullet points].
Structure according to [institutional requirements]. Tone: formal but clear,
evidence-based, constructive. Length: approximately [X] words."
```

**For Research:**
```
"Search [database] for cases involving [topic] under [legal article]. 
Summarize holdings, tests applied, how courts determined standing. 
Provide citations in ECLI format."
```

**For Quality Control:**
```
"Review this draft [document type]. Identify: 
(1) procedural compliance issues
(2) weak arguments needing more evidence
(3) tone problems
(4) missing required elements"
```

### What AI Does Well
✅ Format compliance  
✅ Research synthesis  
✅ Citation management  
✅ Procedural checklists  
✅ Language improvement  

### What AI Does NOT Do
❌ Replace your domain expertise  
❌ Make strategic decisions  
❌ Guarantee accuracy (verify everything)  
❌ Understand informal politics  
❌ Provide legal representation

## Realistic Expectations

### Time Investment by Complexity

**Simple consultation response:** 2-4 hours  
**FOI request with confirmatory application:** 8-12 hours over 3-4 months  
**Ombudsman complaint through investigation:** 20-30 hours over 12-18 months  
**Full court case (Levels 3-5):** 100-200 hours over 2-3 years  

### Success Rates (Realistic)

**Level 0 (Consultation/FOI):** 
- Submission: 99% (purely procedural)
- Impact: Highly variable (depends on quality and timing)

**Level 1 (Ombudsman):**
- Admissibility: 70-80% if you follow guidelines
- Finding of maladministration: 40-50%
- Institution compliance: 60-70% when maladministration found

**Level 4-5 (Courts):**
- Admissibility: 50-60% (standing is genuine hurdle)
- Success on merits: 30-40% of admissible cases
- **But:** Even unsuccessful cases create precedent and public record

### What "Success" Means

**It's not always winning:**
- Public record created
- Institutional pattern documented  
- Precedent for others
- Evidence for media/parliamentary engagement
- Learning for next case

## Common Pitfalls (Learn From Others)

### Mistake #1: Starting Too High
**Error:** Going straight to court without Level 0-2 steps  
**Why Bad:** Courts require exhaustion of administrative remedies  
**Fix:** Follow escalation ladder sequentially

### Mistake #2: Vague Requests
**Error:** "Give me all documents about AI Act"  
**Why Bad:** Institutions refuse as too broad  
**Fix:** Specific dates, document types, topics, actors

### Mistake #3: Emotional Language
**Error:** "The Commission is corrupt and deliberately hiding evidence"  
**Why Bad:** Easily dismissed, undermines credibility  
**Fix:** Evidence-based, procedural critique, constructive tone

### Mistake #4: Missing Deadlines
**Error:** Not tracking when responses are due  
**Why Bad:** May lose rights to appeal or escalate  
**Fix:** Calendar system with alerts, track all deadlines

### Mistake #5: Abandoning After First Refusal
**Error:** Institution says no, you give up  
**Why Bad:** Refusal is normal—it's start of process, not end  
**Fix:** Confirmatory application → Ombudsman → Court pipeline

## Success Stories (Real Patterns)

### Transparency Victories
Multiple citizens using FOI + confirmatory application + Ombudsman have forced disclosure of:
- Lobbying meeting records
- Impact assessment data
- Internal guidance documents
- Correspondence with industry

**Pattern:** Persistence + procedural precision wins

### Enforcement Triggers
Citizens filing formal complaints have triggered investigations of:
- Anti-competitive behavior
- Data protection violations  
- State aid irregularities
- Environmental non-compliance

**Pattern:** Domain expertise + evidence = institutional action

### Policy Influence
Consultation responses with strong evidence have influenced:
- Risk classification criteria (AI Act)
- Technical standards (various regulations)
- Implementation timelines
- Exemption provisions

**Pattern:** Technical depth + early engagement = incorporated feedback

## Remember

**This infrastructure already exists.** The EU created these engagement mechanisms. What was missing was **capability to use them** without paying lawyers €50K-150K.

**AI provides that capability.** Document generation, research, procedural compliance—all at €20/month instead of €50K.

**You have domain expertise.** You know your field, your evidence, your situation better than any Brussels lawyer.

**Combine your expertise + AI assistance + these procedures = Democratic participation at scale.**

**The infrastructure exists. The procedures exist. The rights exist.**

**Now you know how to use them.**

**Questions?** Open a GitHub issue.

**Success or failure?** Document it. Others learn from both.

**Welcome to democratic infrastructure for the AI age.**
