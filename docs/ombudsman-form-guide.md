# European Ombudsman Web Form Guide

Use this as a citizen-facing walkthrough to file complaints efficiently. Keep the main form concise (800–1,000 words) and push detail into annexes.

## What the form asks (and how to answer)
- **Institution/body complained about**: Name the EU body (e.g., European Commission, DG COMP).
- **Access-to-documents? Failure to reply? Employment?**: Tick only if applicable; otherwise “No”.
- **What happened and when**: 3–5 dated bullets (submission, discovery, key correspondence, current status). Stay factual.
- **Why this is maladministration**: 3–6 bullets linking the institution’s act/omission to rules/obligations. Avoid repetition.
- **Harm/impact**: 2–4 bullets on who is blocked/harmed and how (e.g., SMEs/PSPs excluded; legal obligations can’t be met).
- **What should be done to put things right**: 5–8 bullets (reopen assessment; mandate access; ban discriminatory conditions; add verification; interim measures).
- **Prior contact**: Dates + functional inboxes you contacted; note if no reply yet. This establishes admissibility.
- **Court status**: “No” if not pending/decided.
- **Consent to transfer**: Usually “Yes” to allow forwarding if outside Ombudsman remit.

## Annex strategy
- Number and name clearly: `Annex_01_Tech_Analysis.pdf`, `Annex_02_Market_Impact.pdf`, `Annex_03_Remedies.pdf`, etc.
- Each annex should have a 1–2 line description in the form text.
- Include prior correspondence as an annex to prove you contacted the institution.

## Length and tone
- Main text: aim for 800–1,000 words. Use short paragraphs and bullets.
- Tone: factual, procedural, respectful. Avoid slogans; cite obligations (e.g., DMA, PSD3, Reg. 1049/2001) only where relevant.

## Suggested form structure (copy/paste outline)
- **Timeline**: [date] …; [date] …; [date] …
- **Issue**: 3–6 bullets describing what the institution decided/accepted/failed to do.
- **Why it’s maladministration**: 3–6 bullets tied to specific obligations (e.g., execution-layer access, non-discrimination, auditability).
- **Harm**: 2–4 bullets on impact (e.g., SMEs/PSPs excluded; compliance impossible; market remains closed).
- **What should happen**: 5–8 bullets (reopen assessment; mandate FRAND access; default-handler parity; audit/test suite; interim measures if needed).
- **Prior contact**: [date/email] to [inbox], no reply yet / reply inadequate.
- **Annexes**: list numbered annexes with 1–2 line descriptions.
