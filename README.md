# EU Citizen Engagement Toolkit

**Democratic infrastructure for AI-augmented engagement with EU institutions**

## What This Is

This repository provides **templates, guides, and tools** for individuals, small groups, and SMEs to engage effectively with EU regulatory processes—from public consultations to judicial review—without requiring expensive legal representation.

**Key Innovation:** Combines existing EU engagement mechanisms with AI-assisted capability to reduce costs from €50K-150K to under €550 while maintaining procedural compliance and quality.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Templates:** Ready-to-use templates for each engagement level (consultations, complaints, court filings)
- **Guides:** Step-by-step procedures for navigating EU institutions
- **Data:** MEP contacts, institutional structures, case studies
- **Scripts:** Deadline calculators, procedural checklists
- **Examples:** Real-world walkthrough of framework application

## Key Artifacts

- Citizen authorship: `manifesto-human-authorship.md` (root)
- Ombudsman form guide: `docs/ombudsman-form-guide.md`

## Positioning vs. Other Participation Tools

- **Citizens' Engagement Platform (European Commission)** — Official front door for public debates/consultations/Citizens' Panels. Complementary: this toolkit helps citizens use it effectively and escalate beyond it.
- **Citizen-Led Action Toolkit (CitiObs, EU-funded)** — Practical guides for community-led environmental monitoring. Parallel: shows demand for actionable toolkits; here the focus is regulatory/legal process navigation.
- **Your Priorities / Active Citizen (CitizensFoundation)** — Open-source platforms for debate/prioritization. Different domain: provides the tech forum; this toolkit provides the strategic “how” for engagement.
- **NetZeroCities Engagement Tools (EU Mission)** — Frameworks for cities to engage stakeholders on climate. Different audience: aimed at city admins designing processes; this toolkit empowers individuals to navigate them.

**Unique value:** Self-advocacy and execution-layer know-how for regulatory/legal engagement (DMA/PSD/FOI/Ombudsman/courts), not just structured participation via official portals.
