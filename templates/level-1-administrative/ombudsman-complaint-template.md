## What Is Maladministration?

**The Ombudsman investigates:**
- ✅ Administrative failures, irregularities, or neglect
- ✅ Abuse of power
- ✅ Discrimination
- ✅ Lack of transparency (FOI refusals without adequate justification)
- ✅ Unnecessary delay (missing deadlines, unreasonable processing times)
- ✅ Procedural failures (not following own rules)
- ✅ Failure to provide adequate reasons for decisions
- ✅ Inadequate or discourteous communication

**The Ombudsman does NOT investigate:**
- ❌ National/regional/local authorities (use national ombudsmen)
- ❌ Court decisions or judicial proceedings
- ❌ Disagreement with policy choices (unless procedurally flawed)
- ❌ Employment disputes within EU institutions (use internal procedures first)
- ❌ Issues older than 2 years

---

## Before You Complain

**Have You:**
1. ✅ Contacted the institution directly about the issue?
2. ✅ Received a response (or waited reasonable time for one)?
3. ✅ Identified specific procedural failures vs. just policy disagreement?
4. ✅ Collected evidence (emails, letters, dates, reference numbers)?

**If NO to #1-2:** Contact institution first. Ombudsman expects you to give them chance to resolve it.

**Strategic Timing:** 
- File Ombudsman complaint **while pursuing other tracks** (FOI confirmatory application, court prep)
- Ombudsman investigation creates political pressure and public record
- Not legally binding but institutionally significant

- Email address
- Postal address
- Preferred language (any EU language)

**Privacy Note:** Ombudsman may share your complaint with the institution being investigated. Flag if you need anonymity (granted in exceptional cases).

### 2. INSTITUTION COMPLAINED ABOUT

**Be Specific:**

- ✅ "European Commission, DG COMP, Directorate C (Antitrust), Unit C.1"

**How to Find:** Check institution's website for organization chart, or use best knowledge.

### 3. DESCRIPTION OF MALADMINISTRATION

**Structure (500-2000 words recommended):**

**A. What Happened (Chronological)**

[Date] - I submitted [request/complaint/application] to [institution] concerning [specific topic].  
Reference number: [if provided]

[Date] - [What happened next - response received, deadline passed with no response, inadequate response, etc.]

[Date] - I contacted institution again requesting [clarification/action/decision].

[Date] - [Current status]

**B. What Should Have Happened**

According to [cite regulation/procedure/institutional rules], the institution should have:
- [Specific obligation, e.g., "Responded within 15 working days per Regulation 1049/2001, Article 7(1)"]
- [What proper procedure would have been]

**C. Why This Is Maladministration**

The institution's actions constitute maladministration because:
1. [Specific failure, e.g., "Exceeded legal deadline by 40 working days without justification"]
2. [Procedural violation, e.g., "Refused document access without citing specific exception"]
3. [Impact on you, e.g., "Prevented me from exercising my right to review under Article X"]

**D. Previous Steps Taken**

I have attempted to resolve this by:
- [Date]: Contacted [person/unit] via [email/letter]
- [Date]: Submitted formal complaint to [address]
- [Date]: Requested confirmatory application (if FOI case)

I have received [no response / inadequate response / refusal without proper reasoning].

### 4. DESIRED OUTCOME

**Be Specific and Realistic:**

I request that the European Ombudsman:

1. Investigate whether [institution] committed maladministration by [specific actions].

2. Recommend that [institution]:
   - [Specific remedy, e.g., "Provide the requested documents or detailed justification under Regulation 1049/2001"]
   - [Process improvement, e.g., "Implement procedures to meet legal deadlines"]
   - [Accountability measure, e.g., "Acknowledge the procedural failure"]

3. Issue public recommendations highlighting [pattern/issue] to prevent future occurrences.

## Template Example: FOI Refusal

**Section 3: Description of Maladministration**

On 15 October 2024, I submitted a request for access to documents to the European Commission, DG FISMA, under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. I requested:

"All correspondence between DG FISMA and the European Banking Authority regarding the implementation timeline for MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) during the period January 2024 to September 2024."

Reference: GESTDEM 2024/12345

According to Article 7(1) of Regulation 1049/2001, the institution had 15 working days to respond, with possible extension to 30 working days in complex cases if I was notified. The deadline was 7 November 2024.

On 20 November 2024 - 13 working days after the deadline - I received a refusal stating:

"Your request is refused under Article 4(3) of Regulation 1049/2001 as disclosure would undermine the institution's decision-making process."

However, this decision constitutes maladministration because:

1. **Excessive delay:** Response was 13 working days late without any communication about extension or complexity. No acknowledgment was sent explaining the delay.

2. **Inadequate reasoning:** The refusal cites Article 4(3) but provides no explanation of:
   - Which specific decision-making process would be undermined
   - Why these particular documents (correspondence about *implementation timeline*, not policy content) fall under this exception
   - Whether the exception applies to all requested documents or only some
   - Whether public interest in disclosure was considered per Article 4(3) requirements

3. **No reference to confirmatory application rights:** The decision did not inform me of my right to request internal review under Article 7(2), which is required information.

I submitted a confirmatory application on 25 November 2024, but this does not excuse the initial maladministration.

**Previous steps:**
- 15 October 2024: Original request submitted via email
- 25 October 2024: I emailed requesting acknowledgment - no response
- 10 November 2024: I emailed noting deadline had passed - no response  
- 20 November 2024: Inadequate refusal received
- 25 November 2024: Confirmatory application submitted

**I request that the Ombudsman:**

1. Investigate whether DG FISMA's handling of my request constitutes maladministration due to excessive delay, inadequate reasoning, and procedural failures.

2. Recommend that DG FISMA:
   - Issue a proper reasoned decision on my confirmatory application within the legal deadline
   - Provide detailed explanation of why Article 4(3) applies to these specific documents
   - Conduct and document the public interest test required by Article 4(3)
   - Implement procedures to meet legal deadlines for document access requests

3. Highlight this case as example of inadequate transparency practices to prevent future occurrences.

Supporting documents:
- Annex 1: Original request (15 October 2024)
- Annex 2: Follow-up emails (25 October, 10 November)
- Annex 3: DG FISMA refusal (20 November 2024)
- Annex 4: Confirmatory application (25 November 2024)

## Template Example: Excessive Delay

**Section 3: Description of Maladministration**

On 1 July 2024, I submitted a formal complaint to the European Commission, DG COMP, alleging anti-competitive behavior by [Company X] in violation of Article 102 TFEU (abuse of dominant position).

Reference: COMP/C-3/2024/5678

According to Commission Notice on handling of complaints (2004/C 101/05), the Commission should:
- Acknowledge receipt within 7 working days
- Conduct preliminary assessment within 4 months
- Inform complainant of decision to investigate or not

As of 15 December 2024 (5.5 months later), I have received:
- No acknowledgment of receipt
- No preliminary assessment
- No communication about case status
- No response to my three follow-up emails

This constitutes maladministration because:

1. **Failure to acknowledge:** Despite Commission's own 7-day standard, no acknowledgment was sent.

2. **Excessive delay:** 5.5 months exceeds the 4-month preliminary assessment period without explanation.

3. **Lack of communication:** No response to repeated requests for status update.

4. **Procedural rights undermined:** Without any communication, I cannot exercise my right to request review or judicial challenge because I don't know if/how my complaint is being assessed.

**Previous steps:**
- 1 July 2024: Complaint submitted via eComplaint system
- 25 July 2024: Email requesting acknowledgment - no response
- 1 October 2024: Email requesting status update - no response
- 25 November 2024: Email citing excessive delay - no response

**I request that the Ombudsman:**

1. Investigate DG COMP's failure to acknowledge, assess, or communicate about my complaint within reasonable timeframes.

2. Recommend that DG COMP:
   - Immediately acknowledge my complaint
   - Provide preliminary assessment within 30 days
   - Implement reliable acknowledgment and tracking systems for complaints

3. Issue recommendations on minimum service standards for competition complaints.

Supporting documents:
- Annex 1: Original complaint submission (1 July 2024)
- Annex 2: Follow-up emails (25 July, 1 October, 25 November)
- Annex 3: Timeline of events
- Annex 4: Commission Notice on handling complaints (establishing standards)

## After You Submit

**What Happens:**

1. **Immediate:** Automatic confirmation email with reference number

2. **Within 1 week:** Ombudsman office reviews for admissibility
   - Checks jurisdiction (EU institution, not court, not too old)
   - May request clarification or additional information

3. **Admissible cases:** Ombudsman contacts institution for their version
   - Institution has typically 3 months to respond
   - You'll receive copy of institution's response
   - You can reply to institution's version (recommended)

4. **Investigation:** 12-18 months typical
   - Ombudsman may request documents, interviews, site visits
   - You'll be updated on major developments
   - Check status via online portal

5. **Decision:** Ombudsman issues report with findings and recommendations
   - Published publicly
   - Institution must respond formally
   - Creates public record even if institution doesn't comply

**Not Admissible:**
- Ombudsman explains why (wrong jurisdiction, too old, etc.)
- You may be directed to appropriate body (national ombudsman, court)

---

## Strategic Value Even If Not Successful

**Ombudsman Complaint Creates:**
- ✅ Official record of institutional failure
- ✅ Political pressure (public investigation)
- ✅ Documentation for judicial proceedings (shows you exhausted remedies)
- ✅ Pattern evidence if multiple complaints on similar issues
- ✅ Media attention opportunity
- ✅ MEP briefing material (parliamentarians often cite Ombudsman findings)

**Combine With:**
- **Confirmatory applications** (Level 2) for FOI cases
- **Court preparation** (Level 3) if you're building judicial case
- **Parliamentary engagement** (brief MEPs on Ombudsman investigation)
- **Public documentation** (blog/social media about investigation)

---

## Tips for Success

**DO:**
- ✅ Focus on process failures, not policy disagreement
- ✅ Cite specific rules/deadlines institution violated
- ✅ Provide clear timeline with dates and reference numbers
- ✅ Include all relevant correspondence as annexes
- ✅ Propose constructive remedies
- ✅ Be patient (investigations take time)
- ✅ Respond promptly if Ombudsman requests information

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use inflammatory language about institution or officials
- ❌ Make it personal attack vs. procedural critique
- ❌ Complain about policy choices you simply disagree with
- ❌ Submit before giving institution reasonable chance to respond
- ❌ Expect legally binding enforcement (Ombudsman recommends, doesn't order)
- ❌ Ignore requests for clarification from Ombudsman office
