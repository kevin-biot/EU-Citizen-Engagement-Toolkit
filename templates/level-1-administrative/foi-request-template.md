## Before You Start

**Understand What You Can Request:**
- ✅ Internal memos, briefing notes, studies, reports
- ✅ Correspondence between institutions or with external parties
- ✅ Meeting agendas, minutes, attendance lists
- ✅ Legal opinions, impact assessments, draft legislation
- ✅ Complaint files, investigation records (subject to exceptions)

**Common Exceptions (Institution May Refuse):**
- Protection of ongoing decision-making process
- Legal advice confidentiality
- Commercial interests of third parties
- Personal data protection
- Court proceedings

**Strategy:** Request specific documents, not broad categories. Narrow requests are harder to refuse and get faster responses.

## Tips for Success

**DO:**
- ✅ Be specific about dates, document types, topics
- ✅ Reference specific policies, meetings, or decisions if you know them
- ✅ Use document reference numbers if you have them
- ✅ Request "and any related documents" to catch adjacent materials
- ✅ Cite Regulation 1049/2001 explicitly
- ✅ Save all correspondence for potential appeal

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Request "all documents about [broad topic]" - too vague
- ❌ Use inflammatory language or accusations
- ❌ Make multiple near-identical requests (can be deemed abusive)
- ❌ Expect immediate compliance if exceptions legitimately apply
- ❌ Skip confirmatory application if refused (required for court action)

**Strategic Framing:**
- Frame as accountability/transparency interest, not attack
- Show you've done homework (reference specific events, dates, actors)
- Indicate you understand exceptions may apply but want detailed reasoning
- Mention research, civic engagement, or policy improvement goals

## What Happens Next

**Timeline:**
1. **Day 0:** You submit request
2. **Day 1-15:** Institution has 15 working days to respond
3. **Day 16-30:** If complex, institution can extend by 15 days (must notify you)
4. **After deadline:** If no response, you can file confirmatory application

**Possible Responses:**

**Full Disclosure:**
- Institution provides all documents
- Success! You now have evidence for next engagement levels

**Partial Disclosure:**
- Some documents provided, others refused with exceptions cited
- Review refusal reasoning - if weak, file confirmatory application
- Even partial disclosure is useful progress

**Full Refusal:**
- Institution cites exceptions for all documents
- Detailed reasons required citing specific articles
- This is normal - proceed to confirmatory application
- Refusal itself creates administrative record for Ombudsman/court

**No Response (Silence):**
- After deadline, send reminder (see template above)
- After second deadline, file confirmatory application
- Silence = implicit refusal (actionable)

---

## If Request Refused: Next Steps

**Level 2 - Confirmatory Application:**
See `templates/level-2-confirmatory/confirmatory-application-template.md`

Key points:
- Submit within reasonable time (2-3 months)
- Challenge specific exceptions cited
- Request internal review of decision
- This is **required** before going to court

**Level 1 - Ombudsman Complaint (Parallel Track):**
If process itself was mishandled:
- Unreasonable delay
- No detailed reasons for refusal
- Procedural failures

See `templates/level-1-administrative/ombudsman-complaint-template.md`
